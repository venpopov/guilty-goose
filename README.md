## How to download and replicate

TODO: Add instructions for the targets pipeline

1. You can clone the current repository or download the [.zip](https://github.com/venpopov/guilty-goose/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) archive.
2. Open the `guilty-goose.Rproj` file in RStudio.
3. Run the following code to install the required packages:

```r
renv::restore()
```

`renv` is a package that creates a reproduction environment for R projects. It will install the packages listed in the `renv.lock` file, which are the packages used in the project. The `renv::restore()` command will install the packages in a separate library, so it will not interfere with your global library.


## About the project name

The project name is an internal codename generated via the `codename` R package. It is for internal reference only and holds no special meaning:

```r
library(codename)
codename("ubuntu", 62346)
```
